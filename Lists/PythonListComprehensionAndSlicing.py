# List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create a list in python. 
# # We can create lists just like mathematical statements and in one line only. 
# # The syntax of list comprehension is easier to grasp. 

# A list comprehension generally consists of these parts : 
# - Output expression,
# - Input sequence,
# - A variable representing a member of the input sequence and
# - An optional predicate part.

# For example :

# lst  =  [x ** 2  for x in range (1, 11)   if  x % 2 == 1] 

# here, x ** 2 is output expression, 
#       range (1, 11)  is input sequence, 
#       x is variable and   
#       if x % 2 == 1 is predicate part.
# Another example :
# lst=[x**2 if x%2==1 else x*2 for x in range(1,11)]


# Python program to demonstrate list comprehension in Python  
   
# below list contains square of all odd numbers from range 1 to 10
odd_square = [x**2 for x in range(1,11) if x%2==1]
print(odd_square)

# for understanding, above generation is same as,  
odd_square = []  
for x in range(1, 11):  
    if x % 2 == 1:  
        odd_square.append(x**2)  
print (odd_square)

# below list contains power of 2 from 1 to 8 
power_of_2 = [2**x for x in range(1,9)]
print(power_of_2)

#range 1 to 10
lst=[x**2 if x%2==1 else x*2 for x in range(1,11)]
print(lst)

#for understanding ,above "lst" is same as below "lst1"
lst1=[]
for x in range(1,11):
  if x%2==1:
      lst1.append(x**2)
  else:
    lst1.append(x*2)
print(lst1)

# below list contains prime and non-prime in range 1 to 50  
noprimes = [j for i in range(2, 8) for j in range(i*2, 50, i)]  
primes = [x for x in range(2, 50) if x not in noprimes]  
print (primes)  
   
# list for lowering the characters  
print ([x.lower() for x in ["A","B","C"]] ) 
   
# list which extracts number  
string = "my phone number is : 11122 !!"
   
print("\nExtracted digits")  
numbers = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()]  
print (numbers)  
   
# A list of list for multiplication table  
a = 5
table = [[a, b, a * b] for b in range(1, 11)]  
   
print("\nMultiplication Table")  
for i in table:  
    print (i)

# After getting the list, we can get a part of it using pythonâ€™s slicing operator which has the following syntax: 
# [start : stop : steps]  
# - which means that slicing will start from index start will go up to stop in step of steps. 
# - Default value of start is 0, stop is last index of list and for step it is 1 

# - So [: stop] will slice list from starting till stop index 
# - [start : ] will slice list from start index till end 
# - Negative value of steps shows right to left traversal instead of left to right traversal t
#   that is why [: : -1] prints list in reverse order.

# Let us first create a list to demonstrate slicing 
# lst contains all number from 1 to 10 
lst =list(range(1, 11)) 
print (lst) 
    
#  below list has numbers from 2 to 5 
lst1_5 = lst[1 : 5] 
print (lst1_5) 
    
#  below list has numbers from 6 to 8 
lst5_8 = lst[5 : 8] 
print (lst5_8) 
    
#  below list has numbers from 2 to 10 
lst1_ = lst[1 : ] 
print (lst1_) 
    
#  below list has numbers from 1 to 5 
lst_5 = lst[: 5] 
print (lst_5) 
    
#  below list has numbers from 2 to 8 in step 2 
lst1_8_2 = lst[1 : 8 : 2] 
print (lst1_8_2) 
    
#  below list has numbers from 10 to 1 
lst_rev = lst[ : : -1] 
print (lst_rev) 
    
#  below list has numbers from 10 to 6 in step 2 
lst_rev_9_5_2 = lst[9 : 4 : -2] 
print (lst_rev_9_5_2)


# We can use the filter function to filter a list based on some condition provided as a lambda expression 
# as the first argument and list as the second argument, an example of which is shown below : 

import functools

# filtering odd numbers
lst = filter(lambda x : x%2==1, range(1,20))
print(list(lst))

#  filtering odd square which are divisible by 5 
lst = filter(lambda x : x % 5 == 0,  [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 1]) 
print (list(lst))

#   filtering negative numbers 
lst = filter((lambda x: x < 0), range(-5,5)) 
print (list(lst)) 
    
#  implementing max() function, using 
print (functools.reduce(lambda a,b: a if (a > b) else b, [7, 12, 45, 100, 15]))

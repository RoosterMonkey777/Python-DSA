# - Python Lists are ordered collections of data just like arrays (in other programming languages)
# - Allows for different types of elements to be in the list
# - Similar to Vectors in C++ and ArrayList in Java
# - Costly operation is 'inserting' or 'deleting', from the beginning of the list, as all subsequent elements need to be shifted 


List = [1,2,3,"GFG", 2.3]
print(List)

# - Lists are simples containers and need not be homogeneous
# - Lists are mutable (they can be altered after creation)

# Python Program to demonstrate 

List = []
print("Blank List:" )
print(List)

# Creating list of numbers
List = [1,2,3,4,5]
print('\nList of numbers: ')
print(List)

# Creating list of strings and accessing using index
List = ["Hello", "Cheese", "Goat"]
print('\nList Items: ')
print(List[0])
print(List[2])
